# eudaldmoya.github.io


This is a project for university. Consists of a "Twenty One Pilots" website where you can visit a main page with some links and merchandise, 
watch videoclips and listen to albums, know their next concerts and contact them. This is built with HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), Javascript and 
PHP (in Github pages, PHP is not working).
You may realize the videos are not available, that is because this website was stored in the university server along with the videos and Github
does not allow big files to be uploaded.


You can also find a Landing Page built with only HTML/CSS, this consisted on copying an existing site to learn how to organize and style elements in a page.


I have also built some dynamic pages with PHP. I cannot post them here but you can visit them here, visiting the following links:

https://citmalumnes.upc.es/~eudaldmf/p3_progra/home.php  (This is a recreation of Universal Studio Florida website).
https://citmalumnes.upc.es/~eudaldmf/BD/Moya_Eudald_P04BBDD/ (This is a photo posting website where you can visit a feed of images people has posted, see the users profile with its own pictures, and search for words to find images (to log in use email: d@d.com and password: 12345)).
https://citmalumnes.upc.es/~eudaldmf/BD/P03/  (This is a second hand product selling platform where you can sell and buy products and find them in their own category, you can upload new productts and buy the ones existing).
