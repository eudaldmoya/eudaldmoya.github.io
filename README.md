# eudaldmoya.github.io


This is a project for university. Consists of a "Twenty One Pilots" website where you can visit a main page with some links and merchandise, 
watch videoclips and listen to albums, know their next concerts and contact them. This is built with HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), Javascript and 
PHP (in Github pages, PHP is not working).
You may realize the videos are not available, that is because this website was stored in the university server along with the videos and Github
does not allow big files to be uploaded.


You can also find a Landing Page built with only HTML/CSS, this consisted on copying an existing site to learn how to organize and style elements in a page.
